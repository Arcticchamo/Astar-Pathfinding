# Astar-Pathfinding

A piece of software that showcases the A* algorithm within a square grid. 
The software allows the user to place start and end points within a square grid. The user can then set blocking points and difficult terrain around the map. When the map is complete, starting the software with calculate the quickest path to the end point.
